# Two-Body-Problem
When supplied the initial position, velocity, and mass of objects this code will create a graph of their motion.


I wrote this code as my final project in computational physics.

It starts with a single object orbiting a stationary mass. Then with two masses free to move, and finally three masses.

This uses both Euler's Method and 4th order Runge-Kutta in order to solve Newtons Law of Gravitation.
